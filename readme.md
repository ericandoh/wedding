# Next.js Playground

This playground is used by the DX team to explore, test, and demo new Next.js features. It serves as a starting point for writing documentation and helps us understand features, identify bugs, and provide feedback to the Next.js team.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
vercel env pull
pnpm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```sh
vercel dev
vercel deploy --prod
```
